# Some instructions about the ECS781P_MiniProject

1. In "GetRandomCatImages.py", I called the open-source API, which provided by "https://thecatapi.com/", and then used a "GET" method to retrieve random cat details from the website every time you refresh the webpage.

2. In "GetALLCatBreeds.py", I used a "GET" method to call the open-source API to feedback details of the cat's breed.

3. In "AddNewCat.py", I deployed some sample data of cats and then used a "GET" method to call those pre-built data. In addition, a "POST" and a "DELETE" method are also included within it, allowing users to create new cat information or delete an existed cat data.
